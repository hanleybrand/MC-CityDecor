# City Decor
Originally by @TzarAnthony - Recent updates by @Hanleybrand


## Original Description

We have fantastic building textures and models for modern building. Also Cardboard Boxes and Shipping Pallets work like Shulker Boxes

This mod may be included in any modpack!

## Updates by Hanleybrand

I was using this mod in a modpack that I was updating to 1.20, and since citydecor a) wasn't ported to 1.20 and b) had an MIT license, I decided to see if I could update it myself.

Tasks 
- [x] Update to 1.19.2, forge 43.2.8 (just to make sure my dev environment was correct)
- [ ] Update to 1.20.1 
- [ ] Upload 1.20.1 version to Curseforge
- [ ] Upload 1.20.1 version to Modrinth?


### ~~Current~~ TzarAnthony's To-Do List: 

(I have no plans to implement any of these)

- [ ] Log Canopy
- [ ] Cushions (like sittable half slabs, maybe with a little extra design)
- [ ] Maybe a chair?
- [ ] Iron blinds / shutters
- [ ] Steel blinds / shutters
- [ ] Corner pipes (lightning rods)
- [ ] Glass with lightning
- [ ] Pastel and Muted Pastel colored blocks, stairs, and slabs?
